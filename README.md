# CS4240

## All coding was done on Dong Son Trinh's (dtrinh7 | RaitNao | kopotuwka@gmail.com) laptop together with Maxim Mints (mmints3). One of us wrote code and the other sat back and reviewed the code and design of the project. Every hour or so we changed the roles with each other.

## Written in Java, so the `Makefile` is empty.
## Use compiler.jar in the appropriate Project folders
## Otherwise there is a MANIFEST.MF for building the .jar
## Entrypoint is src/com/tiger/Main.java
